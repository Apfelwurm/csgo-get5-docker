# csgo-docker
*Docker image for CS:GO server*

This Docker image is a modified version of [CM2Walki's CSGO Docker image](https://github.com/CM2Walki/CSGO). I mainly wrote it so I could learn Docker.

The image contains CSGO, [MetaMod](https://www.sourcemm.net/), [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/), and [splewis' get5 plugin](https://github.com/splewis/get5) for creating matches.
